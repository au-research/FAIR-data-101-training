ChEMBL is a ‘chemogenomic’ database that brings together chemical, bioactivity and genomic data to aid the translation of 
genomic information into effective new drugs. So it’s useful not only for researchers in public institutions, but drug discovery 
operations in big pharma and small companies too. It brings together many of the FAIR principles for sharing research data.
