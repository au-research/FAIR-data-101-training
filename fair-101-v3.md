Welcome to the Australian Research Data Commons' *FAIR Data 101* self-guided materialsv3!
[DOI: XXX](https://doi.org/XXX)

The course is aimed at individuals working with or expecting to work with data as researchers, publishers, librarians, or in research support, especially those seeking to develop their skills in managing FAIR data in practice and to understand the tools that can support them in doing this.

## Why FAIR?
FAIR stands for **F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable and **R**eusable. 

Making research data more FAIR provides a range of benefits to the wider research community by enabling future researchers to publish, share, cite and reuse research data. The [FAIR Principles](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18) put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. Also note the FAIR Principles are aspirational and generic. 

## FAIR Data 101 Self-guided
The third version of this online course stands as a self-guided material. The total time commitment for participants is minimum 6 hours (only activities and quizzes) and optional 12 extra hours to watch presentation and Q&A discussions. 

## How to run this course

Participants are encouraged to go through the modules in the following order:
- **F**indable: [Activities](https://au-research.github.io/FAIR-data-101-training/findable/activities), [Quizz] 
- **A**ccessible: [Activities](https://au-research.github.io/FAIR-data-101-training/accessible/activities), [Quizz] 
- **I**nteroperable: [Activities](https://au-research.github.io/FAIR-data-101-training/interoperable/activities), [Quizz]
- **R**eusable: [Activities](https://au-research.github.io/FAIR-data-101-training/reusable/activities), [Quizz] 

We recommend doing all the activities per Guiding principle. However, feel free to skip those activities that you are already familiar with. The Quizzes will then help you evaluate your understanding of the topics. You are encouraged to discuss your understanding of those questions and answers with your colleagues. If you need more input to answer one or more questions we encourgae you to watch the corresponsing videos.
