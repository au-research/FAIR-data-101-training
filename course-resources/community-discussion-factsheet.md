# Community discussion roles and topics

## Fact sheet: #FAIRData101 course community discussions 

One of the key benefits of engaging in a virtual training course over several weeks is being able to meet fellow learners and build relationships across overlapping professional communities. Throughout this FAIR Data 101 course we wanted to provide some social infrastructure to complement your learning by assigning explicit roles for the community group discussions. This method has been adapted from a process used in The Carpentries’ Instructor Trainer training process. We’re hoping to facilitate an experience that encourages a sense of belonging and contribution despite the distributed and remote nature of online learning.

## How will the community discussion work?

Course participants have been allocated to 5 discussion groups, distinguished according to 5 different types of orchid, naturally. You will stay in these groups and meet fortnightly over the next 7 weeks. Within these groups, participants have been randomly allocated a role to undertake, which are outlined below. Each group will also have an ARDC facilitator and host to welcome and support the discussions. We have outlined an agenda template for each discussion session. This agenda allows for participants to

* ask questions and discuss in the large group
* join breakout rooms of 3-4 people for more considered reflection  

Each discussion group is supported by a collaborative google doc for participants to sign in and record discussion. 

## Participant roles

You are welcome to swap roles within your group if you can’t attend a discussion. Make sure you update it on your group spreadsheet.

### Discussion leader

* Lead discussion during the session (co-host with power to mute)
* Be prepared with a few responses of your own to kick off conversation if people don't have a lot to say
* Choose additional discussion questions for breakout sessions

Note: this role is not about being an "authority" on the module! Feel free to toss questions back at the group/ at any point.

### Notetaker

* Take notes on the collaborative document, except when you're talking (any other group member will step in)

### Challengers (1 + 2)

* Prepare to challenge assumptions and gently play devil’s advocate during whole group discussion
* Keep an eye out for concepts that participants might find challenging or objectionable, practical pitfalls, and other problems that participants may need to be aware of in applying/promoting aspects of the FAIR data principles.

## Benefits of explicit participant roles

* democratises participation throughout the course
* formalises contribution
* gives participants a manageable number of fellow learners to get to know
* opportunities to practice professional skills
  * coordinating discussion on video conferencing software
  * critical engagement without starting a flame war
  * taking live notes with people watching you typo

## What do we talk about?

Topics for each community discussion can be found in each module's overview.
