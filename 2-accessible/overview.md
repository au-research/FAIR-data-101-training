# Accessible

Accessible describes data that can be potentially obtained by others. It is important to note that the FAIR principles do not require open data - in the absence of open data there
should be a way for others to apply for access. Furthermore, if data are no longer available, the metadata that records it existence must remain available.

**A1. (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communications protocol**

**A1.1 The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable**

**A1.2 The protocol allows for an authentication and authorisation procedure, where necessary**

**A2. Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available**
