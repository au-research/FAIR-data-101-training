# FAIR Data 101

This repository contains most of the material developed for the Australian Research Data Commons' FAIR Data 101 virtual course which was run twice in 2020.
These are both outlined below.

The materials developed for FAIR Data 101 will remain available
on this [ARDC github repository](https://github.com/au-research/FAIR-data-101-training/).

Every effort is made to ensure things and activities remain
current, so please check out [how to contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you have any suggestions or corrections
to submit.

## FAIR Data 101 
Duration: 11 May to 26 June 2020.

The first run was the debut of the [ARDC's Course Code of Conduct](https://tiny.cc/code-conduct), inspired
by the [Carpentries' Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html).

The course is divided into four modules, one for each of the four FAIR foundational principles: [Findable](/1-findable),
[Accessible](/2-accessible), [Interoperable](/3-interoperable), [Reusable](/4-reusable)

During the original run, each module took two weeks and consisted of:
* Two webinars
* A number of small group [community discussions](course-resources/community-discussion-factsheet.md)
* Activities
* A quiz.

The FAIR Data 101 virtual course was presented by the ARDC in 2020. 
Eighty people participated in this multimodal course over eight weeks.
Each two-week module covered one of the four FAIR principles: Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable and Reusable.

In the first week of each module participants watched 
two 45-minute live webinars, and in the second week they took part in a 
[community discussion sessions](course-resources/community-discussion-factsheet.md) (up to 16 participants per discussion group). These were small groups (less than 20 people) on Zoom, and included 2 ARDC staff to facilitate and support.

During each module participants also completed a set of activities and a quiz in their own time. 
The total time commitment for participants was 10 hours over 8 weeks.

After each webinar or community discussion, a short survey was distributed to catch any remaining questions from participants which weren't addressed in the preceeding session. These were built into a rolling FAQ document which was updated and circulated to participants. 

The course was supported by a free Slack workspace, which allowed participants to ask questions to one 
another as well as the course's presenters. This also served as a place to make professional introductions and network nationally with colleagues. All participants were removed from the workspace after the course finished.

## FAIR Data 101 Express
Duration: 7 September to 2 October 2020.

For the second round of this course, we extended the participant's time commitment per week to 3 hours (total 12 hours), shortening the overall duration (4 weeks), and replaced the community discussions with 1 live Q&A webinar per week with an expert panel from ARDC staff and partner organisations. 

Each module ran for 1 week, and consisted of
* 2 pre-recorded webinars (hosted on ARDC's YouTube channel)
* Activity sheet (hosted on GitHub website)
* Quiz (Survey Monkey)
* 1 live Q&A webinar with an expert panel (GoToWebinar)
* FAQ document built from questions arising in the post webinar survey.

The Slack workspace was used again; and was kept open for a further two weeks after the end of the course.
