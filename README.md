# FAIR Data 101

This repository most of the material developed for the Australian Research Data Commons' FAIR Data 101 course,
originally run from 11 May to 26 June 2020.

The first run was the debut of the [ARDC's Course Code of Conduct](https://tiny.cc/code-conduct), inspired
by the [Carpentries' Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html).

The course is divided into four modules, one for each of the four FAIR foundational principles: [Findable](/1-findable),
[Accessible](/2-accessible), [Interoperable](/3-interoperable), [Reusable](/4-reusable)

During the original run, each module took two weeks and consisted of:
* Two webinars
* A number of small group [community discussions](course-resources/community-discussion-factsheet.md)
* Activities
* A quiz

The FAIR Data 101 virtual course was presented by the ARDC in 2020. 
Eighty people participated in this multimodal course over eight weeks.
Each two-week module covered one of the four FAIR principles: Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable and Reusable.

In the first week of each module participants watched 
two 45-minute live webinars, and in the second week they took part in a 
[community discussion sessions](course-resources/community-discussion-factsheet.md) (up to 16 participants per discussion group). 

During each module participants also completed a set of activities and a quiz in their own time. 
The course was supported by a Slack channel, which allowed participants to ask questions to one 
another as well as the course's presenters.

The materials developed for FAIR Data 101 will remain available
on this [ARDC github repository](https://github.com/au-research/FAIR-data-101-training/).

Every effort is made to ensure things and activities remain
current, so please check out [how to contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you have any suggestions or corrections
