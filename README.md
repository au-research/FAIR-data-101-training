# FAIR Data 101

This repository most of the material developed for the Australian Research Data Commons' FAIR Data 101 course,
originally run from 11 May to 26 June 2020.

The course is divided into four modules, one for each of the four FAIR foundational principles: [Findable](/1-findable),
[Accessible](/2-accessible), [Interoperable](/3-interoperable), [Reusable](/4-reusable)

During the original run, each module took two weeks and consisted of:
* Two webinars
* A number of small group discussions
* Activities
* A quiz
