# Overview

This repository contains the material developed for the Australian Research Data Commons' FAIR Data 101 virtual course which was run twice in 2020. 
This material now stand as self-guided from version 3, last updated in June 2021.

## Why FAIR?
FAIR stands for **F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable and **R**eusable. 

Making research data more FAIR provides a range of benefits to the wider research community by enabling future researchers to publish, share, cite and reuse research data. The [FAIR Principles](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18) put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. Also note the FAIR Principles are aspirational and generic.

## Learning objectives
* Discuss the concept of FAIR data and its application in research
* Articulate drivers, barriers, challenges and opportunities for enabling FAIR data
* Refer to hands-on experience with techniques, services and tools (particularly those offered by ARDC) for making data FAIR
* Identify best-practice examples and benefits of FAIR data management
