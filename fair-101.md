Welcome to the Australian Research Data Commons' *FAIR Data 101* course!

The course is aimed at individuals working with or expecting to work with data as researchers, publishers, librarians, or in research support, especially those seeking to develop their skills in managing FAIR data in practice and to understand the tools that can support them in doing this.

Each module covers one of the FAIR principles. You will find all of the supporting materials on this website. For each module, there is:
* two 45-minute lecture videos
* a set of activities
* a recording of a live Q&A webinar
* a quiz to test your knowledge.

Each module should take around 3 hours to complete.
