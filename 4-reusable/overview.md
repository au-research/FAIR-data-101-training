Reusable describes data that can be used again, beyond its original purpose. To be reusable, data not only needs to be described in a way to help others understand it, but also must be licensed with a licence that permits resuse. Furthermore, data must contain information about how it was created - provenance - so that others know whether the data can be trusted.

**R1. (Meta)data are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes**

**R1.1. (Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license**

**R1.2. (Meta)data are associated with detailed provenance**

**R1.3. (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards**

## Activities

Work through these [activities](activities.md) to build your understanding of Reusable.

## Discussion starters

Use these questions to start a conversation on our Slack workspace, or with your colleagues over a cup of beverage.

**Topic questions**
* In the (meta)data that you currently collect, is there much provenance information? How would you go about enhancing the provenance information of the (meta)data that you currently collect?
* Do you currently apply a licence to the training materials that you produce? Do you have a favourite?
**Meta-reflection...**
* How could the FAIR data 101 course be more FAIR? What would you recommend from what you know now?
* Thinking across the content of these 4 modules, what would you like to work on in your organisation, explore further or put into practice? What first steps might you take?
