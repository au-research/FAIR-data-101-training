# Reusable

Reusable describes data that can be used again, beyond its original purpose. To be reusable, data not only needs to be described in a way to help others understand it, but also must be licensed with a licence that permits resuse. Furthermore, data must contain information about how it was created - provenance - so that others know whether the data can be trusted.

**R1. (Meta)data are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes**

**R1.1. (Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license**

**R1.2. (Meta)data are associated with detailed provenance**

**R1.3. (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards**
