Welcome to the Australian Research Data Commons' *FAIR Data 101 Express* course!

The course is aimed at individuals working with or expecting to work with data as researchers, publishers, librarians, or in research support, especially those seeking to develop their skills in managing FAIR data in practice and to understand the tools that can support them in doing this.

Each weekly module will cover one of the FAIR principles. You will find all of the supporting materials on this website. For each module, you will watch two 45-minute videos, complete a set of activities, attend a live Q&A webinar, and complete a quiz to test your knowledge. Each module should take around 3 hours to complete. You will also receive an invitation to join the FAIR Data 101 Express Slack workspace, where you can talk to other people completing the course, ask questions and share your own experiences with FAIR data. 

## Announcements

* **29 September 2020:** It's the last week of FAIR Data 101 Express! The course will be ending soon, but you can come back to this website whenever you want to review the materials. We'll keep the Slack workspace and quizzes open for another two weeks after the course ends so that you can wrap things up. The [course evaluation survey](https://forms.gle/ZPAzap2gevdARNR7A) will be open for two weeks (closing Friday 16th of October) - at the end of the survey you will be linked to the form to request a physical copy of your certificate of participation and sticker.
* **21 September 2020:** We don't always have time to answer all of your questions in the Q&A webinars - you can find the answers to any questions we didn't get to in the [FAQ page](faqs), which updates each week. 
* **7 September 2020:** Please note that the community discussions mentioned in the videos have been replaced by the Q&A webinars for this Express version of the course. You don't need to sign up for a community discussion group, just register for the Q&A webinars. 
* **7 September 2020:** FAIR Data 101 Express officially starts today with Module 1, Findable! To get started, go to [Findable](findable) and watch the two videos there. You can then think about some questions to ask at Wednesday's Q&A webinar (see your welcome email for a link to register for this if you haven't already done so) and complete the activities and quiz. We hope you enjoy the course!
