Welcome to the Australian Research Data Commons' *FAIR Data 101* self-guided materials!
[DOI: XXX](https://doi.org/XXX)

The course is aimed at individuals working with or expecting to work with data e.g. researchers, publishers, librarians, or in research support, especially those seeking to develop their skills in managing FAIR data in practice and to understand the tools that can support them in doing this.

## Why FAIR?
FAIR stands for **F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable and **R**eusable. 

Making research data more FAIR provides a range of benefits to the wider research community by enabling future researchers to publish, share, cite and reuse research data. The [FAIR Principles](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18) put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. The FAIR Principles are aspirational and generic. 

## FAIR Data 101 Self-guided
The third version of FAIR Data 101 has been reworked as a self-guided course. The total time commitment for participants is minimum 6 hours (only activities and quizzes) and optional 12 extra hours to watch the presentations and Q&A discussions. 

## How to use this course materials?

Participants are encouraged to go through the modules in the following order:
- **F**indable: [Activities](https://au-research.github.io/FAIR-data-101-training/findable/activities), [Quizz](https://au-research.github.io/FAIR-data-101-training/findable/quiz) 
- **A**ccessible: [Activities](https://au-research.github.io/FAIR-data-101-training/accessible/activities), [Quizz](https://au-research.github.io/FAIR-data-101-training/accesible/quiz)  
- **I**nteroperable: [Activities](https://au-research.github.io/FAIR-data-101-training/interoperable/activities), [Quizz](https://au-research.github.io/FAIR-data-101-training/interoperable/quiz) 
- **R**eusable: [Activities](https://au-research.github.io/FAIR-data-101-training/reusable/activities), [Quizz](https://au-research.github.io/FAIR-data-101-training/reusable/quiz) 

We recommend doing all the activities for each guiding principle. However, feel free to skip the activities that you are already familiar with. The Quizzes will then help you evaluate your understanding of the topics. You are encouraged to discuss your understanding of those questions and answers with your colleagues. If you need more input to answer one or more questions we encourage you to watch the corresponsing videos. You can find the [video playlist on the ARDC YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG25fMbdLRa7bf4FNTS_LHV7hHOyFvkc-) for exaplanatory videos of each principle. Invited speakers participated in the Q&A sessions and those videos are available online.
