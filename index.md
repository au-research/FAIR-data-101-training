Welcome to the Australian Research Data Commons' *FAIR Data 101 Express* course!

The course is aimed at individuals working with or expecting to work with data as researchers, publishers, librarians, or in research support, especially those seeking to develop their skills in managing FAIR data in practice and to understand the tools that can support them in doing this.

Each weekly module will cover one of the FAIR principles. You will find all of the supporting materials on this website. For each module, you will watch two 45-minute videos, complete a set of activities, attend a live Q&A webinar, and complete a quiz to test your knowledge. Each module should take around 3 hours to complete. You will also receive an invitation to join the FAIR Data 101 Express Slack workspace, where you can talk to other people completing the course, ask questions and share your own experiences with FAIR data.
