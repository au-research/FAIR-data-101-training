## Ways to reuse the FAIR Data 101 material:

-   Use as a self paced learning activity or as a refresher
-   Adopt it as suggested training for all staff
-   Contextualise it for your discipline or situation
-   Adapt it to meet your specific research data knowledge needs

## Ideas for reusing these materials

The possibilities are endless! The materials developed for the FAIR Data 101 course
can be used however you wish. Some ideas
and suggestions are below:

### Self-directed learning activity

Individuals or small groups can work through the program at their own
pace.

-   Work through the modules in your own time
-   Complete activities and quizzes as a group, or work separately and compare your answers
-   Hold your own discussion sessions, using the discussion topics as conversation-starters
-   Complete all four modules, or just the ones you most need to know about or have
    an interest in

### Customise things for different audiences

-   Change the activity links to showcase your data services
-   Adapt the modules for specific audiences and disciplines

### Run your own short courses

Each module has its own section containing the materials and resources on that topic.
Run some short courses for your work group, new inductees or
other groups at your institution.

-   Each module takes around 3 hours to complete - have your learners watch the webinars
    and complete the activities and quizzes in their own time, and hold a 45-minute
    discussion session for each module
-   Migrate the quizzes into the software of your choice to use as a measure of participation or an assessment tool
