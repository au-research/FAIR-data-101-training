Welcome to the Australian Research Data Commons' *FAIR Data 101* course v1!

The course is aimed at individuals working with or expecting to work with data as researchers, publishers, librarians, or in research support, especially those seeking to develop their skills in managing FAIR data in practice and to understand the tools that can support them in doing this.

## Description
The first version of this online course was delivered between 11 May to 26 June 2020. The total time commitment for participants was 16 hours over 8 weeks.
The course was divided into four modules. Each two-week module covered one of the four FAIR principles and consisted of two webinars. You can find the [video playlist on the ARDC YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG25fMbdLRa7bf4FNTS_LHV7hHOyFvkc-).

## How to run this course
The FAIR Data 101 virtual course was presented for the first time by the ARDC from May to June 2020. Eighty people participated in this multimodal course over eight weeks.

In the first week of each module participants watched
two 45-minute live webinars, and in the second week they took part in a
[community discussion sessions](course-resources/community-discussion-factsheet.md) (up to 16 participants per discussion group) together with 2 ARDC staff to facilitate and support.

During each module participants also completed a set of activities and a quiz in their own time.

After each webinar or community discussion, a short survey was distributed to catch any remaining questions from participants which weren't addressed in the preceeding session. These were built into a rolling FAQ document which was updated and circulated to participants.

The course was supported by a free Slack workspace, which allowed participants to ask questions to one
another as well as the course's presenters. This also served as a place to make professional introductions and network nationally with colleagues. All participants were removed from the workspace after the course finished.

All individuals part-taking in this course were encourage to follow the [ARDC's Course Code of Conduct](https://tiny.cc/code-conduct), inspired
by the [Carpentries' Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html).
