Findable describes data that can be discovered by others. Even if the data itself is not available, the *metadata* is registered or indexed in a searchable resource,
and contains a globally unique and persistant identifier that can be used to disambiguate between similar, but not identical, data.

**F1. (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier**

**F2. Data are described with rich metadata ([defined by R1](../4-reusable/overview.md))**

**F3. Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe**

**F4. (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource**
