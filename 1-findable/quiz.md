1. Which one of these is not a core aspect of FAIR?
- [ ] Findable
- [ ] Accessible
- [x] Identifiable
- [ ] Reusable

+   Correct! Interoperability is a core aspect of the FAIR. The use of identifiers is common to Findability and Accessibility.
-   Sorry, that is one of the core aspects of FAIR. You might like to visit the GO FAIR website.

2. Which of these are drivers of the FAIR guiding principles? Select all that apply
- [x] To reduce the duplication of effort in producing research data
- [x] To make it easier to verify the results of research
- [x] To allow research data from different sources to be combined for new discoveries
- [x] To extract the maximum benefit from research investment
- [x] To make data easier to use for humans
- [x] To make data easier to use for machines
- [ ] To make sensitive data openly accessible
- [ ] To force researchers to share research data

+   Yes, those are all drivers of the FAIR guiding principles.
-   Sorry, your answer is not quite correct.

3. In which discipline-focussed data repository can you find the data for Andrei Korostelev et al. (2007) Interactions and dynamics of the Shineâ€“Dalgarno helix in the 70S ribosome,
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 104 (43) 16840-16843; DOI: [10.1073/pnas.0707850104](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0707850104)?

- [ ] GenBank
- [x] Protein Databank
- [ ] AuScope Discovery Portal
- [ ] Astrophysics Data System
- [ ] [ICPSR](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/)


4. What role does the ARDC take in enabling FAIR data? (select all that apply)
- [ ] Creates metadata for all Australian research data
- [x] Represents Australia in the development of international standards
- [x] Provides infrastructure and services for Australian research organisations*
- [ ] Trains researchers in FAIR data practices
- [x] Partners with Australian research organisations on FAIR data projects
- [ ] Operates a national Australian data repository


5. What qualities of identifiers do the FAIR principles recommend?
- [ ] Continue to operate indefinitely
- [x] Unambiguously identify data and metadata
- [x] Continue to operate for the foreseeable future
- [ ] Take the form of hyperlinks


6. For each of these components of the research lifecycle, select the most appropriate PID

- [ ] Professor Fatima Mohamed (ORCiD)
- [ ] The Kepler Space Telescope (Handle?)
- [ ] A meteorite discovered in the Eyre Basin (IGSN)
- [ ] A research project to investigate the galactic centre (RAiD)
- [ ] Data resulting from the analysis of a mineral sample from the Yilgarn Craton (DOI)

7. Which of the following identifier services does the ARDC provide?
- [x] Handle
- [x] DOI
- [x] RAiD
- [x] IGSN
- [ ] ORCiD

8. Which is the most complete metadata record?

- [ ] [Supp 3 Raw Data](https://figshare.com/articles/Supp_3_Raw_Data/5593756) Although this has a DOI, licence and essential metadata, it is hardly rich or descriptive
- [ ] [Register Book of Crown Grants and Land Title, Freehold](https://researchdata.ands.org.au/register-book-crown-title-freehold/152518) Although lots of detail in description field and broad metadata, there is no DOI, nor is the technical metadata necessarily up to date.
- [ ] [Coral reef health database (Reef Check Australia)](https://eatlas.org.au/data/uuid/e8854605-d169-44ca-9364-aa5c2c87ff67) Aggregated metadata is more meaningful for humans on RDA, enough metadata but not extensive
- [ ] [Pharmaceutical industry-funded events for Australian health professionals (Oct 2011-Sept 2015)](https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/handle/2123/20223) DOI, licence, descriptive metadata, related things
- [ ] [GrazFeed](https://data.csiro.au/collections/#collection/CIcsiro:36747v003) DOI, subjects, related things, licence, description, people have ORCiDs

9.  How can data repositories enable FAIR data?
- [ ] Paying researchers to deposit their data Sadly, no, significant and successful govt lobbying will be required for this
- [x] Using persistent identifiers
- [x] Pursuing CORE Trust Seal certification to become a Trusted Data Repository
- [x] Facilitating access to data
- [x] Preserving and providing long term access to data
- [x] Using community agreed metadata standards
- [x] Assisting data depositors to provide rich metadata [Yes, systems and tools which only ask for metadata once and reuse from elsewhere make for a better experience for humans and machines]
- [ ] Enabling a wide variety of data description practices [Sadly no, heterogenerity of metadata values can make data more difficult to find, even if there is a lot of it. We will pay more attention to vocabularies in Module 3]


10. Which of the following repositories is the odd one out? 
- [ ] Australian Data Archive [ADA is a data repository for Australian social science data]
- [ ] CSIRO Data Access Portal [CSIRO DAP is the institutional data repository for a govt scientific organisation]
- [ ] Datadryad [Although Datadryad started as a data repository for the biological sciences, it has grown in scope to include many other science data]
- [ ] ICPSR [ICPSR although based at the University of Michigan, is supported by a consortium of about 750 members]
- [x] Research Data Australia [Correct! RDA is a metadata aggregator and repository, not a data repository, although it shares some of the same resources]
