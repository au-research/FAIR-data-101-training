12. Which is the most complete metadata record?

- [ ] [Supp 3 Raw Data](https://figshare.com/articles/Supp_3_Raw_Data/5593756) Although this has a DOI, licence and essential metadata, it is hardly rich or descriptive
- [ ] [Register Book of Crown Grants and Land Title, Freehold](https://researchdata.ands.org.au/register-book-crown-title-freehold/152518) Although lots of detail in description field and broad metadata, there is no DOI, nor is the technical metadata necessarily up to date.
- [ ] [Coral reef health database (Reef Check Australia)](https://eatlas.org.au/data/uuid/e8854605-d169-44ca-9364-aa5c2c87ff67) Aggregated metadata is more meaningful for humans on RDA, enough metadata but not extensive
