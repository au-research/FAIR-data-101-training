1. Which one of these is not a core aspect of FAIR?
- [] Findable
- [] Accessible
- [*] Identifiable
- [] Reusable

+   Correct! Interoperability is a core aspect of the FAIR. The use of identifiers is common to Findability and Accessibility.
-   Sorry, that is one of the core aspects of FAIR. You might like to visit the GO FAIR website.

2. Which of these are drivers of the FAIR guiding principles? Select all that apply
- [*] To reduce the duplication of effort in producing research data
- [*] To make it easier to verify the results of research
- [*] To allow research data from different sources to be combined for new discoveries
- [*] To extract the maximum benefit from research investment
- [*] To make data easier to use for humans
- [*] To make data easier to use for machines
- [] To make sensitive data openly accessible
- [] To force researchers to share research data

+   Yes, those are all drivers of the FAIR guiding principles.
-   Sorry, your answer is not quite correct.
