## Read
Read the article where it all began: the FAIR Guiding Principles were first 
codified in [The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and 
stewardship](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18) (Wilkinson et al. 2019).

You might also like to explore [the GO FAIR website](https://www.go-fair.org/).

## Create and link
If you do not already have one, [register for an ORCiD](https://orcid.org/register).

Then, see if you can link your ORCiD to your institution’s research systems.
